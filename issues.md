im my cards Editor one i press enter it adds a space then if i press ctrl+enter i go to a new line in a buggy way i need to fix that

i need to handle form validation

i need to handle fetch errors
i need to add loading state

maybe when i add SupaBase i will have the ability to to fetch only the deck name and ids in the the home page not not my entire database
