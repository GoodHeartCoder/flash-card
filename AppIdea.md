# Feature I Want in This App

---

**1.** the ability to add flashCards and make them all in one deck  
**2.** the question should be a text but the answer can be an image  
**3.** the ability to browse the cards to edit them or delete them  
**4.** different ways of studying with those flash cards:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• go from the first card to the last one in a ordered way  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• get randomly ordered cards  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• you can select how many cards you want to study in the session  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• the anki way with the FFSR algorithm(or the older one)

# Problems:

- how many answer buttons I should give to the user in the other modes? (other then FFSR)
- how should i handle wrong answers, what algorithm i should implement?
- where can i get the FFSR algorithm and integrate it to my app?

# things to consider:

there is different way to implement the flash card so i need to make my app flexible enough to support different flashcard formats and study modes, and possibly allow for future expansion if I want to add new features or change how cards are presented.
